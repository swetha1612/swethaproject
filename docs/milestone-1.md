4. ## Application Overview**
   My idea is to create a tool for mindful living amongst people, especially college students. We are often times bombarded with tons of work be it from class or jobs elsewehere. This causes us to feel overwhelmed and anxious, therefore negatively impacting our mental health and overall wellbeing. My application would aim to help its users create a comfortable schedule and would suggest mindfullness breaks and activities that one may be inclned to participate in. I would also want my applocation to send out a positive message each time the user opens it to keep reminding them that they are important and an integral part of society.
