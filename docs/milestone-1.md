4. ## Application Overview
   My idea is to create a tool for mindful living amongst people, especially college students. We are often times bombarded with tons of work be it from class or jobs elsewehere. This causes us to feel overwhelmed and anxious, therefore negatively impacting our mental health and overall wellbeing. My application would aim to help its users create a comfortable schedule and would suggest mindfullness breaks and activities that one may be inclned to participate in. I would also want my applocation to send out a positive message each time the user opens it to keep reminding them that they are important and an integral part of society. 

5. ## Functionality
   The app takes in information about the user's schedule. This information is taken for the user to get suggestions to add mindfullness into their        everyday life. By monitoring time spans of work and the duration of which time block, the application can suggest when to take breaks, when the time blocks are too long, and also what could be the most productive time of the day for the individual.
